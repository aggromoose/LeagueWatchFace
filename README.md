# League WatchFace

## Overview
I got a ZenWatch 2 for christmas so naturally I decided to create a custom watch face for it. 

##Design
<img src="https://github.com/aggromoose/leaguewatchface/blob/master/preview.png" height="300" /><br/><br/>

##Functionality
The watchface changes the background of the watchface to the champion you are currently playing or your last played champion.  The bundled app allows you to enter in your summoner name or someone else (if you want), even allowing for a manual override for the background champion.

##Install

1. Get your league api key, developer.riotgames.com
2. Create a blank text file named "key" in /mobile/src/main/res/raw/
3. Put only the api key inside the text file
4. Build and install
